To run the file (assuming you are already inside the "hw0" directory),
first compile topword.cpp using the command below:
g++ topword.cpp -o topword

then call the executable with arguments as such:
./topword "input=testcasefile.txt;output=yourfilename.txt"

Failure to include arguments will yield a message and exit the program.

To run the file (assuming you are already inside the "hw1" directory), all you need to do is call python3 followed by the name of the python program and the arguments that will be passed to the program.
The arguments are in a specific format such that they count as one argument when passed in. 
This is what that looks like: "k=#;input=#####;output=####", where the # symbols are replaced with the different user-specifications.
Failure to provide enough arguments (such as excluding k=#) will result in the program exiting with an error message stating that there is not enough arguments.
On the other hand, failure to provide an incorrectly named argument will also exit the program with a corresponding message.
For example, if ".....;outpot=out.txt" were passed, the error message will state that the argument "output" was not found because that is what the program was looking for.

This program does not take rank ties into consideration or rare cases, but it does try to be as general as possible.

[RESUBMISSION]:

For my resubmission, the issue with my program is that it did not match the specified output.
My program wrote "integers:" and "reals:" to the file instead of "integer:" and "real:".
In order to fix that issue, I have modified lines 96 and 98 to write the intended output.
There are two import statements at the top of the program (lines 1 and 2) that are leftover from development.
They were auto-generated by Visual Studio Code, and they are not being used by any subsequent lines of code.

# programming-languages-and-paradigms
This repository contains all work done in the "COSC 4315 - Programming Languages and Paradigms" course taught by Carlos Ordonez at the University of Houston for the Fall 2022 semester.

The files contained here are going to be homework files written with a mix of C++, Python, and Javascript.
Earlier files will focus more on traditional/the prevailing style of programming, while later files will focus more heavily on the functional style.
